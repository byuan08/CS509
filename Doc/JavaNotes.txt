# Default access modifier - no keyword
available to any other class in the same package 
Fields in an interface are implicitly public static final and the methods in an interface are by default public

# Class and interfaces cannot be private

# If the public class we are trying to access is in a different package, then the public class still need to be imported although public grants universal access

# All public methods and variables of a class are inherited by its subclasses
